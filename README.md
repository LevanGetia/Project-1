# This is a collaborative project authored by: Cesar Zea, Xingjia Wang, Levan Getia and Angelo Horvath
# This project/code aims to analyse all the csv files that you will feed to it under the directory 'Stocks'
# It then will determine riskiness of those assets by measuring their volatility
# Afterwards it will output different type of portfolio selection based on the investors' risk preference and predict prices of the stocks after one year
# Finally, it is designed to show visualizations of price gains and volatility (st. Dev), code also uses finnhub API function to check current price of the stock and compare it to our project prediction.
